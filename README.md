# 1. Business Understanding 'Classification of Zambian Parliamentary Questions Order Papers.'
## Problem Statement
Each time there is a parliamentary session, the Zambian National Assembly releases Order Papers that include a large number of questions from members of parliament. These enquiries are usually divided into two categories, kind (written, oral, urgent) and subject (agriculture, education, health). However, the existing method of recognising and categorising these issues is labour intensive, manual, and prone to errors. This makes it challenging for interested parties like scholars, journalists, and the general public to find and evaluate questions of interest in a timely manner. Therefore, an automated system that can correctly categorise Order Paper questions into their respective types and subject categories based on their textual content is required. This will allow for better data driven insights into parliamentary activities, faster information retrieval, and increased transparency.
This project seeks to develop this same automated system to classify parliamentary questions in Zambiaâ€™s Order Papers by type and subject, addressing the inefficiencies and inconsistencies of manual categorisation to improve accessibility, transparency, and analysis of legislative activities.
